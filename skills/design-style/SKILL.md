# Design Style Matcher

## Overview

Match any website's design style from a curated collection of 58 design systems. Provides pixel-perfect UI generation via structured design tokens, color palettes, typography rules, and component patterns.

## Progressive Disclosure

This skill uses three-level loading:

1. **Metadata** (~100 words): `name` + `description` above — always in context
2. **SKILL.md body** (<5k words): This file — loaded when triggered
3. **Bundled resources**: `references/designs/*.md` and `assets/preview.html` — loaded as needed

## Trigger Patterns

Activate when user mentions:

- A specific website: "make it look like Vercel", "参照 Airbnb"
- Design style request: "minimal dark theme", "科技感风格"
- UI generation: "create a landing page like Linear"
- Pattern matching: "give me Stripe's checkout style"

## Usage Modes

### Mode 1: Direct Specification

```
User: "make it look like Stripe"
→ Load references/designs/stripe/DESIGN.md
```

### Mode 2: Interactive Selection

```
User: "show me some design options"
→ Open assets/preview.html for visual browsing
```

### Mode 3: Category Filter

```
User: "something minimal and developer-focused"
→ Filter by "Developer Tools" → present options
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Intent

| User Input | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|
| "like Vercel" | Direct spec → load vercel |
| "show options" | Browse mode → open preview.html |
| "minimal dark" | Category filter → minimal/dark designs |
| "playful" | Category filter → colorful/creative |

### Step 2: Extract Design Tokens

From loaded DESIGN.md:

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, accent with hex codes
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing**: 4px base grid scale
- **Components**: Button, card, input, navigation patterns
- **Shadows**: Elevation system with exact values
- **Border Radius**: Consistent rounding values

### Step 3: Apply to Generation

Use tokens to generate code with:

- Exact color codes from palette
- Specified font stacks
- Documented component structures
- Defined spacing scale
- Shadow/elevation values
